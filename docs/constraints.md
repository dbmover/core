# Dbmover\Constraints
Abstract base-plugin for migrating constraints.

Vendors should implement a vendor-specific constraints plugin based off this.

## Installation
```sh
$ composer require dbmover/constraints
```

    Note: the vendor-specific constraints plugin will already require this
    package, so manual installation will seldom be needed.

## Usage
See `dbmover/core` for general DbMover usage.

## Contributing
